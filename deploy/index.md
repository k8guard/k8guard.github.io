For production it is recommended to deploy k8guard to a namespace with the same level of access as kube-system.

To try it locally on your machine, three options:
1. [Minikube](/deploy/minikube/)
2. [Docker-compose](/deploy/docker-compose/)
3. [Helm](/deploy/helm/)

Before deploying make sure to follow these steps first:

* [First Time Developer-Setup](/deploy/developer-setup/)
* [Build the Project](/deploy/build/)
